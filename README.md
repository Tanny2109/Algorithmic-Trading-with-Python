# Algorithmic Trading in Python

This is a self-initiated project where I've explored about algorithmic trading and made three python scripts with three different strategies to invest the portfolio amount in the S&P 500 stocks.

A detailed description about the strategies can be found in the README.md file inside the folders with the names of the strategies used.
